# Agenda

1. Importance of Teams
2. Team Configuration
3. DEMO - Generate Documentation & Team Model
4. Teams as a Service
5. Automation
6. DEMO - Automate Communication & Repository Framework
8. Why use this tooling?
9. What next?

???

Talk about why teams are important first and how they are just as important as your technical boundaries.
This will lead us into why we think its important to store your team as configuration, allowing you to define
what a team is and automatically deploy required assets.
Using this simple schema and values entered to generate team documentation and create a graph model to analyze
off the back of it. 
Anil to talk about offering team components as a service and how this can be automated. 
Then a Demo setting up comms and repository base for a team automatically based off the schema.
Then talk about why we would want to use this tooling and ideas for what else we could use it for.

# Importance of Teams

## Why create a team?

???

We need to understand this fundamental question before we get into the complexities of multiple teams
and considering their interactions.

---

# Importance of Teams

## Why create a team?

* Large numbers of staff cannot communicate well, therefore teams will have a finite number of staff.

* Teams are setup so that members can collaborate easily on a problem.

* Teams can have some focus on common internal team priorities. 

* Teams can have common communication ceremonies. 

* Teams can have common rights and tooling to a team common environment.

???

When the number of people in an organization gets too large then it is impossible for them all to work on one task. 
Teams are setup then to create pockets of people that can together work on smaller tasks within an organization.
These pockets of people have a finite number of people so as to avoid too many people communicating with one another 
and having too many tasks conflicting with each other.
Ideally these teams would be able to meet the tasks they are given which reflect the internal team priorities.

You know what its like with scrum teams, once you get to a certain number of people above say 5-8, there is
a lot of irrelevant chatter and priorities become difficult to distinguish.
You go from a focal point of desired business value to far too many threads on a single node of your business 
that cannot complete.

* Teams can have some focus on common internal team priorities. 

* Teams can have common communication ceremonies. 

* Teams can have common rights and tooling to a team common environment.

* **Teams allow for multi-threaded organizational goals to be achieved.**

* **In order to take advantage of multiple threads handovers should be limited.**


???

The reason that a company setups teams is therefore so they can break down manageable workloads and distribute them amongst an organization. 
This allows an organization to have multiple threads at any one time if tasks are distributed and managed correctly. 

You go from a focal point of desired business value to far too many threads on a single node of your business 
that cannot complete.

# Importance of Teams

* Q. If **Jim** is in a team with **Alex** and not in a team with **Rodney**, who is it likely that **Jim** is going to work with more often, **Alex** or **Rodney**?

Answer: **Alex**


<html>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/BasicTeamCommJim.png" width="90%" height="60%" />

???

Answer is Alex.
Same team as Jim, therefore common ceremonies, common priorities, likely to work together more.

# Importance of Teams

* Q2. If **Rodney** is in a team with **Jasmine** and not in a team with **Jim**, who is it likely that **Rodney** going to work with more often?

Answer: **Jasmine**

<html>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/BasicTeamCommRodney.png" width="90%" height="60%" />
</div>
</html>

???

Rodney is a good example to focus on here.
At first it might seem that well people will speak to one another anyway and this is an easy thing to overcome... 
but there are two opposing forces against Rodney speaking with Alex for example.
It is not just the fact that Alex is in a different team, but Rodney is in his own team. Each team having their own internal priorities 
and ceremonies and methods etc means that it is never easy to speak to members in other teams, particularly if this is exarcebated
by team members constantly having to speak to multiple other teams. The drag can become immense. 
So you have internal forces - e.g. meeting coordination, at conflict with meeting coordination in another team.
This may seem obvious, but all the communication pathways multiplied across every individual mean that communication 
within a team should be far easier
than across teams.

* **Internal team communication & methods pull you in, separate team communication & methods pull others away**
* **Consideration therefore should be taken when designing parallel team threads**

# Importance of Teams

* Too frequent cross team communication (handovers) will lead to drag and frustration.
* Team members will therefore default to solve a problem within a team as much as possible.

  <div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/BaicTeamLovelyProblem.png" width="90%" height="60%" />
</div>

???

Based on the lead time we just established, people will try and solve the problem, or a problem locally.
This may not be the problem that needs to be solved but being engineers we will solve it nonetheless. 

---

# Importance of Teams

* Team setup then influences the problems that can be easily solved within a team and will produce an architecture reflecting that.
* If these domains are functional then business value cannot be achieved within a single team.
* Multi threaded business goal achievements are lost.

# Importance of Teams

* Some problems may, for example, still require data skills as a focus.  
* However, the teams should always be built around a business problem and not be led with a functional solution.
* The skills are then organic attributes of a team out of solving a business problem, and not mandated with team inception, allowing for evolution.

# Teams Configuration

## Designing teams is not simple

* Teams can own multiple domains and products
* Techniques such as [event storming](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l5MkTHM=/) help us understand business problems and appropriate domain boundaries

# Teams as a Service (TaaS)

### In order to get our business threads running as quickly as possible we require...

* #### Layers as a Service (LaaS)
* #### Communication as a Service (CaaS)
* #### Repositories as a Service (RaaS)
* #### Environment as a Service (EaaS)
* #### Deployment as a Service (DaaS)
* #### Governance as a Service (GaaS)

### Each of these can be derivatives of the main team configuration schema

???
Anil talk about TaaS

Layers - include AD security groups and networking. 
Communications - slack channels, email distribution groups, teams teams &  channels
Repositories - code repos, work management, knowledge base
Environment - Azure subs, google big query projects, AWS subs
Deployment - service connections linked to environments
Governance - Azure policies, e.g. require team tag, best practices baked into estate to allow teams to deploy and have automated feedback

---

# Automation

### Python code performs Automation
### Service module configuration held in JSON code

```json
{
  "modules": {
      "slack": {
          "config": {
              "API_TOKEN": ""
          },
          "features": [
              {
                  "name": "channels"
              }
          ]
      },
      "azdevops": {
          "config": {
              "PAT_TOKEN": "",
              "Organisation": ""

# What next?

* **LaaS** - generate activity directory groups "{Team Name} Team" with members allocated. 

* **EaaS** - Generate Cloud environments for {Team Name} and apply AD groups. 

* **DaaS** - Generate service connections to environment for {Team Name} and link with  Devops deployment.

* **CaaS** - Create slack team handles based on {team name} and team members.

* **GaaS** - Enforce resource tagging with policies established from well known team names configured in source.

### Automating all this drastically reduces lead time for new starters and business thread throughput, constrained by a well governed model.


---

# What next?

* Link team tag names of resources to team configuration to understand ownership of an estate more clearly.

* Use team model to highlight colours with team inefficiencies, like roles missing or cross-team employees.
